# Short, Properly Capitalized Title of RFC

<!-->Your title should convey the basic jist of your proposed changes. It should be short.<!-->

<!-->Avoid modifying the first two rows of the table<!-->
| Lead Author(s) | Implemented | GitHub Links |
|---|---|---|
<!-->Fill in this bottom row:<!-->| Your Name(s) Here | :white_check_mark: Yes or :warning: Partially or :information_source: Open PR or :x: No | PR Link(s) or TBD |

<!-->
`Lead Authors` should be the names that you use on GitHub and/or Discord. This is optional but strongly recommended, since:

- This acknowledges credit where it is due
- People who are confused about the written intent can use this information to contact the authors

`Implemented` is the status of the feature. The PR implementing this RFC should go back and edit this RFC accordingly and include a link to the PR.

Github links can include multiple PRs, if relevant. If it has not been implemented at all, leave as "TBD" (to be determined).

<!--> For each subsection below, replace the explanatory text with your proposal <!-->

## Overview

A short, roughly one paragraph summary of what this proposal is about. A high level "overview" or "what this does".

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Design

This is the bulk of the proposal. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the language to understand, and include examples of how the feature is used. Also describe how codebases operating on BYOND can still utilize or ignore the feature as they see fit.

## Considerations & Drawbacks

What are some aspects we should consider? Why should we *not* do this?

Focal points should include (but are not limited to):
- Performance
- BYOND parity
- Impact on users migrating to OpenDream
- Impact on *all* major SS13 forks and potentially other BYOND games, not just the author's codebase
